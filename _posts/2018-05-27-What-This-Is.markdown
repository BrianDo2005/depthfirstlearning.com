Welcome! We made this for you. 

Why? Because there's a flood of information out there on machine learning and it
is woefully insufficient in two ways that we all recognize.

The first is that while there is a terrific amount of resources online for
picking up machine learning in 24 hours, there is not nearly as much that treats
this as a ten year endeavor. When you start thinking that way, you really want
to consider the trunk of your tree foremost before each convolutional leaf.

The second is that there is no bridge from where we came from before to where we
are today. Without that, it is really hard to insightfully propose directions on
where to go. It is one thing to understand how TRPO works and all together
another to grasp why the authors made the choices that they did and what they
knew before that to influence those choices.

This public repository of depth-first study plans is the outcome of an effort to
address those shortcomings in the machine learning research world. DFL was
designed to be shared with and grown by the community. If you are interested in
developing your own curriculum for a paper that we do not already host, we will
help you! Reach out to us at depthfirstlearning@gmail.com. We want your help in
growing this resource and making it richer.
